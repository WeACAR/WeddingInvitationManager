# Environment Variables Setup - Summary

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Environment Variables Created**
All configuration values from your appsettings.json have been converted to environment variables:

#### Database Configuration
- `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` - Your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string

#### Logging Configuration  
- `Logging__LogLevel__Default` - Set to "Information"
- `Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft.AspNetCore` - Set to "Warning"

#### General Configuration
- `AllowedHosts` - Set to "*"

#### WhatsApp Configuration
- `WhatsApp__ApiUrl` - WhatsApp API endpoint
- `WhatsApp__ApiKey` - Empty (ready for your API key)
- `WhatsApp__BusinessNumber` - Empty (ready for your business number)

#### File Upload Configuration
- `FileUpload__MaxSizeBytes` - Set to 10485760 (10MB)
- `FileUpload__AllowedImageTypes__0` through `__4` - Image file extensions
- `FileUpload__AllowedContactTypes__0` through `__3` - Contact file extensions

### 2. **Files Created**
- `setup-environment.ps1` - PowerShell script to automatically set environment variables
- `.env.template` - Template file showing all required environment variables
- `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `.gitignore` - Protects sensitive files from being committed to git

### 3. **Security Improvements**
- Removed sensitive connection string from appsettings.json
- Added .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data
- Environment variables are now stored securely in your user profile

## üîß How to Use

### For Development
1. Environment variables are already set up on your machine
2. The application will automatically use them instead of appsettings.json values
3. You can modify them by re-running the setup script or setting them manually

### For Production/Other Environments
1. Copy the `.env.template` file
2. Set the appropriate values for your environment
3. Use your hosting provider's environment variable configuration

### To Add WhatsApp Integration
Set these environment variables with your actual values:
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("WhatsApp__ApiKey", "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("WhatsApp__BusinessNumber", "YOUR_BUSINESS_NUMBER", "User")
```

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Security**: Sensitive data no longer hardcoded in config files
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to change values without modifying code
3. **Environment-specific**: Different values for dev/staging/production
4. **Source Control Safe**: No sensitive data in your repository
5. **Industry Standard**: Following .NET Core best practices

## üîç Verification

Your application is now configured to use environment variables. You can verify this by:

1. **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Build succeeded with environment variables
2. **Runtime**: Application loads configuration from environment variables first
3. **Fallback**: If environment variable is missing, it falls back to appsettings.json

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test your application** to ensure everything works correctly
2. **Update your deployment scripts** to set environment variables in production
3. **Share the `.env.template`** with your team members
4. **Set up CI/CD** environment variables for automated deployments

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- ‚úÖ Database connection string is now in environment variables
- ‚úÖ appsettings.json no longer contains sensitive data
- ‚úÖ .gitignore prevents accidental commits
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are user-specific and secure

Your application is now properly configured with environment variables and follows security best practices!
